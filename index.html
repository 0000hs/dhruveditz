            <p class="about">Hello everyone MY name is dhruvsaini
            At the age of 15 .I start capturing the moments and that hobby made me more hunger to know the deep knowledge of the
            pohtography
            But due to financial unstable i find out that i can't make my dream true of being a photographer
            It is quit upsed and depresseed moments of my life but then i thought that may be there are so many individual who might
            kill there dream
            just becouse they can't buy that expensive camera,lens and other gears .
            So , I started working on my dream or i will say our dream to find the solution of that formula
            well thanks to our technology that in present time our phone is enough to capure a amazing photo that we can capure only
            by the camera
            i m not going to lie that smartphone can fullfill the camera needs in all prospective
            but we can do so much tnen we can thought buy just one smartphone
            and that tricks that discover during my trials and experiments that help me to achieve my goal will be so helpful for
            each individual .
            i called them the 'photography hacks'.
            TO know more about my tricks and my works please visit to my social platforms
            I HOPE YOU LIKE MY WORK .</p>
